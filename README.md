# push_swap

This project revolves around sorting data on a stack, using a restricted set of commands and minimizing the number of actions
required. Achieving this goal entails working with different sorting algorithms and selecting the most suitable approach for
efficient data arrangement. In this context, I've implemented and fine-tuned the radix algorithm, which leverages bit-shifting
operations.
